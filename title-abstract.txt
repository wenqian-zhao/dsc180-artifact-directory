Title:
Tree-based method towards the Estimation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect of Education on Earning

Abstract:
Over the past few decades, thousands of studies have been focusing on investigating the rate of return to education. Although a vast majority of them indicated a positive relationship between education level and income, social scientists who are using traditional methods such as classification and regression trees (CART) and OLS have to be meticulous to make inferences about their causal relationship and one of the big concerns is the omitted variables-It is hard to tell whether higher education attainment causes somebody to earn more or the higher income is caused by other factors such as the individual’s ability. In the traditional use of CART, such methods are used to predict outcomes given a population and its covariates, typically with the ground truth for each observation already known. However, when using CART for estimating causal effects rather than prediction when we have no knowledge about the effect of the treatment, meaningful results become far more challenging to obtain, with bias and sparsity becoming increasingly arduous to maneuver. This paper intends to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) of education level on earning using the “honest” estimator proposed in the paper Comprehension and Reproduction of Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects, written by Susan Athey and Guido Imbens. The authors created and benchmarked an unbiased estimator of CATE across subsets of the population with different treatments, proposing an “honest” approach for estimation. An “honest” approach with CART involves using one sample to construct partitions in the tree and using a separate sample to estimate the treatment effects, which removes spurious correlations between the covariates and outcomes in the model. Therefore, we aim to apply this approach to get an unbiased estimate of the CATE of college education on earnings.
